        At Lifting Honduras, transparency is at the heart of our mission. Every donation directly
        supports our annual missions—providing school supplies, art kits, and hygiene essentials to
        children in rural Honduran communities. Monetary donations also give us the flexibility to
        purchase exactly what is needed and help cover essential travel and transportation costs,
        allowing our team to safely reach remote villages and personally deliver resources. We
        maintain clear financial records and board oversight to ensure all contributions are used
        responsibly and effectively.
